# Multi-Tweet
An Alexa Skill developed that manages posting tweets from multiple Twitter accounts using voice controls.
We wanted to give userâ€™s control with a simple managerial style, and to minimize code and
improve simplicity. We focused on our social media platform to be Twitter and we used Alexa for
our voice user interface for our first implementation. However we also included another
implementation guide for using Facebook and Azure instead in the Final Seminar Paper. We included the ability to post
from specific or multiple accounts, and retrieving posts about yourself or other users, as well as
managing these accounts such as adding new ones or deleted other ones. This enables users
to perform simple and repetitive tasks automatically with little effort.

Our development progression as well as more information can be seen on our website.
